C-Breez is the simplest self-custodial app for sending and receiving Lightning payments. It's a Flutter mobile app that serves as a reference implementation for the [Breez SDK - Native](https://sdk-doc-greenlight.breez.technology/) to:
* Demonstrate the full capabilities of building with the SDK
* Showcase best practices for designing an intuitive UI and UX for self-custodial Lightning payments
* Offer a ready-made solution that can be white-labeled for partners looking to build a new app
