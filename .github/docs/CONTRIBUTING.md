# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to C-Breez!

We welcome contributions from everyone and appreciate your help in making C-Breez better.

## How to Contribute

### Communication First

**Always communicate before coding!**

Notify the issue author that you're interested in picking up the issue and wait to be assigned.
- This prevents multiple people working on the same issue and speeds up the review process.

Should you encounter other issues, please let us know by filing an [issue!](https://github.com/breez/c-breez/issues/new/choose)

### Branches

All changes for the next release are made on the `main` branch.

### Pull Requests

We prefer pull requests that:
- Include a brief explanation of changes in the PR description
- Have links to relevant issues or related PRs
- Focuses on a single change (_avoid large refactors or unrelated style fixes_)
- Follow the existing code style

Feel free to make as many commits as needed, as long as they are clear and descriptive.

### Git Workflow

Use `rebase` as the merging strategy & avoid `merge` commits while syncing your remote fork.

## Linting and Formatting

Our code follows a 110-character line length limit.
- Run `dart format -l 110 .` from project root before submitting your commits

Consider [Setting up Lefthook](LEFTHOOK.md) in your environment.

## Troubleshooting
Please refer to the [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide for assistance.
